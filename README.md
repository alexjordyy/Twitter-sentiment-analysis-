# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
This machine learning project is used to analyze the sentiment of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as either positive or negative based on their content.

The process includes:

Preprocessing tweets (cleaning, tokenizing, removing stopwords, and stemming)

Converting text into numerical features using CountVectorizer

Training a Logistic Regression model

Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix

This system can help understand public opinion.
